  name={MAVlink},
  description={MAVLink is a very lightweight messaging protocol for communicating with drones and between onboard drone components. It follows a modern hybrid publish-subscribe and point-to-point design pattern where data streams are published as topics while configuration sub-protocols such as the mission protocol or parameter protocol are sent as point-to-point with retransmission. Messages are defined within XML files. Each XML file defines the message set supported by a particular MAVLink system.}
