\section{Quadcopter flight tests}

\subsection{Build process}
\label{sec:test-7-builddrone}

% Setup:    build drone, configuration, calibration
% Test:     - RC, GPS, 
%           - Arm, takeoff commands
%           - Camera holder
% Results:  wiring, drone pictures, QGroundControl calibration screens
%           holder 3d, drone close-up, camera feed


\subsection{Basic tests}
\label{sec:test-8-flight}

% Setup:    flight plan
% Test:     - assisted takeoff, fly with RC
%           - tools/test_camera + record video
% Results:  video of flying

\subsection{Hand gesture control}
\label{sec:test-9-hand}

% Setup:    ...
% Test:     - Hand solution on windows through telemetry radio
%           - Free movement with offboard api
% Results:  video of flying, output from program

\subsection{Target detecting, tracking and following}
\label{sec:test-10-follow}

% Setup:    ...
% Test:     - Follow solution on RPi
%           - Controller response to real input
% Results:  video of flying, output from program
