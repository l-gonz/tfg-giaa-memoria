\section{PID tuning and controller validation}

% Process of tuning the PIDs
% Graphs from test-controller
% Analysis of error

\section{Testing the software-in-the-loop simulation}

% Setup:    build from source code on WSL
% Test:     - Jmavsim simulator
%           - Hand solution: (on Python Windows?????)
%               - Mediapipe
%               - Pilot module
%               - Video input
% Results:  images from jmavsim, dronecontrol output, px4 console

\section{Testing the AirSim simulator}

% Setup:    installing AirSim, AirSim config explanation
% Test:     - AirSim simulator
%           - Follow solution:
%               - Pose detection
%               - Images from simulator
%               - Control from PIDs
%               - Failsafes
% Results:  images from airsim, dronecontrol output, px4 console

\section{Testing the hardware-in-the-loop simulation}

% Setup:    build drone, HITL configuration
% Test:     - AirSim + follow on Windows + Pixhawk
%           - QGroundControl (without program running)
%           - PX4 to computer connection
%           - RC on AirSim
% Results:  images of wiring computer-Pixhawk

\section{Testing the Raspberry Pi as the companion computer}

% Setup:    Raspberry Pi installation, RPi-Pixhawk connection
% Test:     - AirSim + follow on RPi + Pixhawk
%           - Serial connection
% Results:  wiring, performance metrics

\section{Testing the onboard camera}

% Setup:    installing AirSim, AirSim config explanation
% Test:     - AirSim + hand-solution on RPi + Pixhawk + onboard camera
%           - Camera holder
% Results:  holder 3d, drone close-up, camera feed

\section{Testing a fully-built drone}

% Setup:    build drone, configuration, calibration
% Test:     - RC, GPS, Pixhawk power supply, RPi power supply
%           - Arm, takeoff commands
% Results:  wiring, drone pictures, QGroundControl calibration screens

\section{First flight tests}

% Setup:    flight plan
% Test:     - takeoff with QGC, fly with RC
