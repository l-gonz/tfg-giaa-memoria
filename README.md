The popular open-source platform PX4 aims to facilitate the programming of unmanned
aerial vehicles and their integration with new sensors and actuators and make it approach-
able for the common developer. This thesis aims to demonstrate how this platform can be
used to develop solutions that integrate computer vision techniques and use their input to
control the movement of an aerial vehicle while employing easily-available and affordable
hardware with basic specifications. For this purpose, a viable solution is presented that
allows a drone to use an onboard camera to identify and keep track of a person in its field
of view to follow their movement.
