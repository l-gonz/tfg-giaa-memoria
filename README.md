The popular open-source platform PX4 aims to facilitate the development and integration
of new solutions for unmanned aerial vehicles, making them approachable for the common
developer. This thesis aims to demonstrate how this platform can be used to develop
and test control strategies that integrate existing computer vision techniques, using their
input to control the movement of an aerial vehicle while employing readily available and
affordable hardware components with basic specifications. To showcase the tools available,
a viable solution is presented that allows a drone to use an onboard camera to identify and
keep track of a person in its field of view to follow their movement.
