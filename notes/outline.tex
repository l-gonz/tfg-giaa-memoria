FIX OUTLINE - CHAPTER 3
3. Design and implementation
Summary of simulation, system architecture and software architecture
3.1 Simulation and development environment
Summary of sim and dev: mention three parts (flight stack, simulation engine, companion)
3.1.1. SITL and HITL simulation
        --> define the flight stack (what the simulation is simulating, what is simulation)
        --> define both types, differences, advantages
        --> define the feedback loop (3.1 without messages)
3.1.2. Simulation engine
        --> analyse 3.2 (expansion of 3.1), explain each component inside [Simulator] and what it means for this particular project
        --> Options for simulation engines / advantages of AirSim over the rest
        --> Last element of 3.2 = companion computer / offboard API, where our software is
        --> (Â¿ own section ?) Communication between elements of 3.2: flight stack, engine and api (Mavlink / UDP / mavlink messages)
3.2.3. Development environment
    SITL configuration
        --> general (3.3)
        --> WSL
        --> analyse connection and ports (3.4, make as clear as 3.3, change port 14550 or explain (doesn't match 3.3))
        --> how to start
    HITL configuration
        --> Pixhawk
        --> analyse connection and ports (3.5, match clarity)
        --> how to start
    AirSim environment
        --> Unreal project and models
        --> Unreal configuration / AirSim settings
    Testing flow
        --> Simulator start script
        --> Play unreal, start simulator, start offboard
